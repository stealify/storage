Diffrent Storage Implementations to fullfill diffrent needs like not getting spyed by your State.

## Design Pattern 1
nextcloud is relative save when configured right but if you need more we would need something like stealifycloud

- Stores everything in encrypted files that get only decrypted client side in memory in a virtual pc via a side channel that gets controled again only by the virtualPC 
- for Android Devices it would be possible with something like Ubuntu Touch(virtualPC)
- for x86 and ARM and so on it is possible via a virtualPC and the virtualisation interface of the kernel

The virtualPC is still attackAble. Via the kernel while it can detect tempering 

http3/Quic is a protocol implementation that could enable in and output 

the InterOp Pattern would be the share with App Pattern so your app needs to share the decrypted data to the None Secured App.

Camera Access and other access can be locked via a concept that we call virtualLoopHoleInit. It is based on audio and Video Processing that allows us to use the device in a none linear way to confuse anything that tempers with the device hardware even if it comes from outSide.

So The key Concept is Isolation via untemperable Encryption... Something which should be standard right?
